Darren,Nyx_,0044,Nyx_0044,,,,"Certainly, my child.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0049,Nyx_0049,,,,"A gift as beautiful as this requires reciprocity, dear child. I wished, regardless, to provide to you a token of my love.",,,
Darren,Nyx_,0050,Nyx_0050,,,,"An offering, to me, dear child? Then, it is only reasonable that I make to you an offering, in kind. I thank you, and I wish for you to have this.",,,
Darren,Nyx_,0051,Nyx_0051,,,,"I am unable to accept such a kind offering, dear child, unless you likewise take this trifle of a gift?",,,

Unused,Nyx_,0067,Nyx_0067,Story Conversation 2 - Athena,,,"Tell me something, child. Has the goddess Athena thus been true to her word, in her willingness to lend you her support?",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0068,Nyx_0068,follows previous,,"Zag: She has, Nyx. I am grateful that you put us into contact, and explained to her the situation that I'm in.","It gladdens me to hear it. Seldom do Olympians consort with those born of the Underworld, yet your circumstances seemed due cause for an exception. She shall make a powerful ally.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0074,Nyx_0074,To Megaera Conversation 1,"Real talk with Megaera, reassuring her. Here we see that Nyx is caring for more than just Zagreus and will not take sides in a dispute, but will share her empathy and compassion evenly.",,"We each have our commitments to this House, daughter. There is no shame in yours. And whilst your sisters are away, you bear their burden of responsibility, as well.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0076,Nyx_0076,To Megaera Conversation 2,"Woman-to-woman talk with Megaera; doling out sage advice. We miss the first part of this conversation because we're eavesdropping, but they're talking of professional matters.",,"...and so, who else is there to be depended on...? Although, I urge you also to look inwardly, daughter. How you approach your work is vital to the end result.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0079,Nyx_0079,Megaera Conversation 3,She finds this delightful because she senses some insinuation here. She is suggesting Meg is adopted or not her daughter in a traditional sense. This is also a rare time we hear her ghostly laughter.,"Zag: 'Nyx, this may be awkward, but, is Megaera your real daughter...? I was just, kind of wondering.'","Hah, haha. She is a daughter to me, as you are my child, child. I am the night itself. Past that, I am unable to explain. Though I am pleased to see the two of you on better terms of late.",,,
Unused,Nyx_,0081,Nyx_0081,To Hades Conversation 1,Speaking subserviently to Hades.,"Hades: 'You are not to aid him in these matters, Nyx. Do we have an understanding?'","We have an understanding, Lord. I am committed to this realm, and to this House. And I remain, as ever, in your debt.",,,
Unused,Nyx_,0082,Nyx_0082,To Hades Conversation 2,"Standing firm, sticking up for herself vs. Hades, matching him pound for pound.","Hades: 'I know that you are helping him. What do you expect me to do about this, Nyx? Deception, in my very house and home.'","My relationship with him remains unchanged, my lord. He has my full support, and always shall. You must know this. He wishes now to leave. I shall make no attempt to stop him.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0090,Nyx_0090,Alt Intro,,,"Do not despair and hold to your resolve, child. Tell me something; has the goddess Athena thus been true to her word, in her willingness to lend you her support?",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0091,Nyx_0091,Alt Intro (Redo),,,"Do not despair, child. Such setbacks are inevitable, and may be overcome with effort and with time. Though, tell me, has the goddess Athena thus been true to her word?",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0092,Nyx_0092,,,"She has, Nyx. I am grateful that you put us into contact, and explained to her the situation that I'm in. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out.","It was the least that I could do. The Olympians typically do not involve themselves in Underworld affairs, yet your circumstances seemed due cause for an exception. They shall make powerful allies. But, reveal to them no more than they already know. For all our sakes.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0096,Nyx_0096,,,"No, Nyx, please, it's... quite all right. You may not have given birth to me, but you still cared for me. I never doubt that. Likewise, is it... is it all right that I refer to you by name?","It is more than all right, my child.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0099,Nyx_0099,About Persephone 2,,"Nyx, if I can ever make my way from here, out to the surface... how do you know that I can find her? The instructions you gave me... how can you know for sure that's where she is, that she hasn't left, or...?","Your mother was a spirited woman. What can I tell you, child? I cared for her and her predicament. When she departed, I bent the light for her, shrouding her path, though I myself could see it. I trust I now do not betray her confidence by telling this to you.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0107,Nyx_0107,,Thoughtful modesty.,"Megaera: ...Thank you for the advice, Nyx. I don't know what I'd do without you. Or what this House would be if not for you.",We all do that which is within our power.,,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0115,Nyx_0115,,,"What, Father can't control the pest problem? Never thought I'd be of any help rampaging through the upper levels of his domain.",Do as you must. Your victory is within reach.,,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0133,Nyx_0133,,"Not meant to be sinister, just matter-of-fact and polite.","I will. I promise, Nyx. And if there's anything you ever need that I can do, well... please, just ask of me.","I do know where to find you, Megaera.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0135,Nyx_0135,,,"I hope that you are right. You always have been, it's just that... I wish I had your confidence in this.",It is yours for the taking.,,,

Integrated,Nyx_,0138,Nyx_0138,With Thanatos Chat -- Matters of the Heart,"Thanatos is asking about whether he's reading his relationship with Zagreus correctly, and whether his mother approves. She says he is, and she does.","Thanatos: You would know best about this, Mother, so, please, tell me what you think. Because if I am wrong...","I trust you are not wrong, my son. I trust you are not wrong. And, as for what I think... it pleases me to see your disposition has been better, as of late. You work so very hard.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0139,Nyx_0139,,,"What does work have to do with anything? Other than, all this really is quite the distraction from it.","To be distracted from one's work from time to time has its uses, Thanatos. You may find your work shall benefit over the longer term. Though, if that were your only focus, we would not be having this discussion, now.",,,
Unused,Nyx_,0140,Nyx_0140,First Clear,,,"Your father fell to you, as once his father fell to him. Although, you were substantially more merciful, it seems, since he is here. I know it is a bitter victory, at best.",,,
Unused,Nyx_,0141,Nyx_0141,,,"Oh, I don't know, it honestly felt pretty high up there as victories go. The only shame is cutting Father down to size changes so little around here on its own. He's going to pretend like everything is still OK.","If you can surpass him once, then you have the capacity to achieve your true goal. Not that I ever doubted you, except... I know the effort that it must have taken, to have come this far.",,,
Unused,Nyx_,0173,Nyx_0173,,,"I have to say, and I do mean this as a compliment: it's hard for me to imagine Night Incarnate herself fashioning these little keepsakes to be given between friends.",Do not mistake them for their unassuming look. For they are catalysts of extraordinary power. The unbreaking bond between two souls conjoined.,,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0181,Nyx_0181,,Tender moment between foster mother and son.,"Well, I mean every word. I love you, Nyx.","I love you, too, my child.",,,
Integrated,Nyx_,0201,Nyx_0201,,"Telling Dusa as she leaves. Subtext is: ""Don't screw up again.""","What, I, Miss Nyx, you mean... like, start right now? Now now? I mean, I, I don't have a lot of pressing obligations, so, I'll do it, YES!! I accept! I'm so excited to be back! Where do I even start, I can survey the lounge, sweep the cobwebs, walk Cerberus, check the pantry, ah, OK, I'm off!!",Do your best work.,,,

And, that I think fondly on the time she spent with us? Please tell her that, for me.",,,
Unused,Nyx_,0295,Nyx_0295,,,,"She did not feel that she belonged, I think. It was a very difficult adjustment she was forced to make. And... she feared that she would inevitably end up caught between Olympus and this realm. That she might start a war.",,,
