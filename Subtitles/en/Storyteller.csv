Integrated,Storyteller_,0265,Storyteller_0265,,,,"Imagine that Prince Zagreus experiences some sort of joyous outcome, for a change, in contrast to the arbitrary and unfortunately painful death he shall experience... now.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0266,Storyteller_0266,,,,"After defeating his lord father, yet again, Prince Zagreus begins to shiver, and catch cold. And, as is well known, there sadly is no cure for such a thing.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0267,Storyteller_0267,,,,"As he explores the wonders of the world, Prince Zagreus discovers a quaint farm, in which he carelessly trespasses, stepping on a farming-tool, which swoops up and strikes him in the forehead, fatally.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0268,Storyteller_0268,,,,"One might suppose the Prince's tale most likely ends akin to other tales of the heroes of our time, like so:",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0276,Storyteller_0276,,,,"The favor-doing Zagreus then walks into a chamber, black as night, but with a blood-red pool, and from it comes a voice which says: Would you mind diving in these waters, Prince? To which the Prince replies, Oh! Sure.",,,

Integrated,Storyteller_,0278,Storyteller_0278,,,,"The often-dying Prince, having achieved his purpose, then reflects upon his life and deeds, remembering his many past demises with such vivid clarity, that this occurs:",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0279,Storyteller_0279,,,,"In his great hurry to explore the country-side, the hapless-footed Prince steps on the peel of a most-exotic sallow-colored fruit, and tumbles backward with such sudden, violent force that you-know-what occurs.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0280,Storyteller_0280,,,,"There are a myriad of tales to be told, of both great deeds and of vainglorious defeats, and this has been a tale that falls somewhere in the middle, overall.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0281,Storyteller_0281,,,,"He cannot kill me like this every time, believes the Underworld Prince. He shall eventually have no more ideas. But the Prince, as often is the case, is wrong.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0283,Storyteller_0283,,,,"Just when his victory was all but certain, a fissure opens underneath the feet of the ill-fated Prince, and from it vents a cloud of superheated water-vapor; steam, as it is known! And probably you know what happens next.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0285,Storyteller_0285,,,,"One of these days, or nights, not so very long from now, the Prince may finally traverse beyond this point. And then, what shall become of him, and I? Well, hopefully, not this:",,,

Integrated,Storyteller_,0299,Storyteller_0299,,,,The Prince decides he's better things to do.,,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0300,Storyteller_0300,,,,The often-dying Prince but wastes his time.,,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0301,Storyteller_0301,,,,Perhaps the good Prince ought do something else?,,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0302,Storyteller_0302,,,,"Upon the surface realm, the mortal-loving Prince would doubtless find that death still comes in a variety of different forms. One of the most common, yet perhaps least interesting, involves simply waiting... long... enough... until...",,,

Integrated,Storyteller_,0338,Storyteller_0338,,,,"Having achieved his goal, the Underworld Prince discovers that the mortal realm is utterly bereft of the life-threatening excitement to which he has grown accustomed, and the lack of anything of note to do, the sheer mundanity, results in this:",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0340,Storyteller_0340,,,,"Thus was Hades, feared ruler of the dead, reunited with his long-lost bride, Persephone, the Queen; and, together with their firstborn son, Prince Zagreus, they would go on to reign eternally beneath the earth, in relative harmony.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0341,Storyteller_0341,,,,"The Queen's return marked an occasion of enthusiastic joy... so much as possible, in that dark, gloom-filled realm of the dead.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0342,Storyteller_0342,,,,"And, even after all this time, Olympus never did discover what transpired there in the Underworld.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0343,Storyteller_0343,,,,"Thus did all of Olympus journey deep into the Underworld, all together, for the very first time. ",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0344,Storyteller_0344,,,,"The Queen Persephone revealed herself in all her splendor, much to their surprise, and told them everything she indicated to her son.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0345,Storyteller_0345,,,,After the shock subsided... the festivities began.,,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0346,Storyteller_0346,,,,"When finally the great feast ended, all the Olympians returned to their mountain abode, fully satisfied; as for the House of Hades, it required thorough cleansing, from the rafters to the floor.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0347,Storyteller_0347,,,,"Such revelry, of course, is unbecoming of the name of Hades, and the fearsome reputation of the Underworld. For, if mortals were to have no fear of death, then they would have no fear of anything at all.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0348,Storyteller_0348,,,,"A well-kept family secret, then, this would live on to be.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0371,Storyteller_0371,,,,"Thus, having once more gained the surface of his grim-faced father's realm beneath the earth, resourceful Zagreus makes his way toward the one-time abode of radiant Persephone.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0372,Storyteller_0372,,,,"It is a journey of considerable distances, which he has already completed many times, and which has always ended in the same result. So... imagine he made it there with just time enough to water the crops and tidy up a bit before...",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0376,Storyteller_0376,,,,"Having gained the surface once again, Prince Zagreus breathes deeply of the wildflowers, and the roses, and the like, among which one of them contains an allergen so intolerably potent, that it causes this:",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0377,Storyteller_0377,,,,"As he journeys to his mother's cottage in the cold, loudly-speaking Zagreus calls out to hear the echo of his voice, the blast of sound causing a substantive amount of ice and snow to break off from a nearby mountaintop, and fall, and fall, and...",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0378,Storyteller_0378,,,,"So complicated is the path to the well-hidden cottage of Persephone that surface-walking Zagreus on this particular occasion sadly zigs instead of zags, plummeting from off a precipice into most-familiar waters...",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0379,Storyteller_0379,,,,"Amid the wondrous ever-springing garden of Persephone, Prince Zagreus discovers a greenish plant of some sort, supple-skinned and covered all in spines, a bit too small to see, until it is too late...",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0380,Storyteller_0380,,,,The limitless variety of fauna dwelling on the surface brings to Zagreus no shortage of delight.,,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0381,Storyteller_0381,,,,"...I have no new tales left to tell. But do not think that you have won, Prince Zagreus... for any tale worth telling... is a tale worth telling again, and again, and again. Bye-bye!",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0382,Storyteller_0382,,,,"Horned creatures are familiar to Zagreus, having fought countless Satyrs and the like; but he discovers, this time, that not even Satyrs possess the sheer, ferocious power of a startled mountain-goat...",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0383,Storyteller_0383,,,,"Snakes and serpents rank amongst the creatures somewhat known to Zagreus, due to their presence in the Underworld.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0384,Storyteller_0384,,,,"So it is with delight that he approaches one upon the surface, greeting it as a familiar friend. It greets him venomously back, using its fangs.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0385,Storyteller_0385,,,,"Once more, tenacious Zagreus achieves his lofty goal, and, just as every time before, except with some sort of new twist of Fate, perhaps, he goes a little distance, then he dies.",,,

Integrated,Storyteller_,0407,Storyteller_0407,,,,"She eloped with grim Lord Hades, she said; mothering a fire-stepping prince who sought to reconnect with his extended family.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0408,Storyteller_0408,,,,"Hades and Persephone at first refused his wish. But, so moved were they by his relentless struggles to the surface, that at last, they decided to heed their willful Zagreus, and reach out. For his and everybody's sake.",,,
Integrated,Storyteller_,0409,Storyteller_0409,,,,"The Olympians listened to all this in stunned silence. Then Zeus, himself, began to laugh. Welcome back into the family, he said.",,,
