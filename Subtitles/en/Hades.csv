Greg,Hades_,0071,Hades_0071,,,,"Blast you, brother Zeus, and you as well, Poseidon, both of you, you mis'rable ungrateful wretches. You, and all your pig-faced children, and your concubines, all there with you, all gaily celebrating every waking moment there upon your mountain, while I alone, alone! remain at work, here, tending to the blasted remnants of those mortals whom you send to me in droves, in DROVES, without regard, without so much as reaching out to me from, time to time, to check upon your oft-forgotten brother? With whom you sealed those blasted Titans underneath this realm, so that you could consort without concern, as now you do?! That such a fate as this would have been wrought for me, by those three cursed hags, or by the two of you, I swear, I swear...! And do not get me started on that damned ungrateful little runt now tending to his hopeless undertaking at my own expense, brazen little bastard that he is. His mother would be oh so very proud, so very proud, no doubt, to see him violating my domain, my home, my rules! The boy, he's even got into the dog's damned heads with his damnable notions, certainly his mother's guiles, plainly on display. Those fools upon Olympus, all abetting his inglorious attempts to give up everything he has, to give up everything I ever gave him!",,,
