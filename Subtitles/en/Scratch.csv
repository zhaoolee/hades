Integrated,Scratch_,0011,Scratch_0011,,,,"Let me give you a piece of advice, boyo. You run across a guy like me out there, you just give him a good stab right in the back without a second thought before he sends you crying back to Big Papa over there.",,,

Integrated,Scratch_,0014,Scratch_0014,,,,"Zagreus. I'm Artemis, Athena told me about you. Let's just say I'm sympathetic to your plight. Soon, I think your enemies will come to fear the power of the hunt.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0015,Scratch_0015,,,,"Why hello, hello, there, little godling. I have to say you're quite the specimen, and so, I've decided I shall aid you for the moment. You interested?",,,

Integrated,Scratch_,0018,Scratch_0018,,,,"Tell him for me, please.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0019,Scratch_0019,,,,"I'm, uh, kind of in the middle of a set here, Zag, if you don't mind? Wouldn't do to interrupt your father's music hour. 'Course, you're welcome to stay and have a listen, if you want....",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0020,Scratch_0020,,,,"Oh, uh, hey Zag, I was just... reminiscing I suppose, about Eurydice, you know her right? Still trapped somewhere out there, and all because of me. I think I'm finally getting over it, though.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0021,Scratch_0021,,,,"Wait wait wait back up, back up a moment, Zag, you're telling me you saw her? My Eurydice, out there? And she said... all of that? I, I, I, I don't, I don't know what to say, I... I think I need a moment here.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0022,Scratch_0022,,,,"Greetings there, young man. Look, your father's always been rather difficult, which is why we aren't close. But we can fix that. You come join us on Olympus, and we'll soon have you living in the proper style. For now, you have my blessing.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0023,Scratch_0023,,,,"Hoy there little Hades! You recognize your uncle, do you not? We've a lot of catching up to do, but first things first, you get yourself out of that dour place down there. As for me, I'll see if I can shake things up a bit to cover your advance.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0024,Scratch_0024,,,,"You've quite the fighting spirit in you there, I have to say. Most intriguing. Though, no surprise for someone born in hell itself. I happen to be a student of death, you know. You come on out of there, and tell me all about it.",,,
Integrated,Scratch_,0025,Scratch_0025,,,,"Heeey, there, Zag, how's it going? Look, you have got to get here with the rest of us already, we been saving you a spot! Let me see what I can do, make life a little sweeter for you in the meantime....",,,
Darren,Scratch_,0026,Scratch_0026,,,,"Hey, Zag, it's me! Look, lemme see what I can do to help. I been bussing souls down there practically forever and I always figured you don't belong there anyhow. So let's get you out!",,,
Darren,Scratch_,0027,Scratch_0027,,,,"Well I must say, and I don't say it lightly: I'm impressed with your performance, Zagreus. I didn't know what to expect, either, but! You've earned my favor. Now, hasten from that place already, and join your rightful family, up here.",,,
